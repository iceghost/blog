title: Notion Formula Editor - Part 1: Concept

Today, an interesting idea striked me: a formula editor for Notion.

This seems easy enough to do but I have no idea why there hasn't been any progress on the web.

The general idea is to make an editor with a simple language, substituing variables with simple formula into more complex formulas for copy-paste.

Let's give it a spin! (some day hopefully)
